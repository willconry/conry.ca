            Hello! My name is Will Conry, I'm Canadian ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦, I recently graduated from McMaster Universityâ€™s Software Engineering program, and I'm currently seeking employment.
            I have a general interest for all areas of technology but I'm particularly interested in machine learning and web development. 
            My hobbies include running, cooking, and reading things on the web.

        <p>
            This website is meant to provide basic information about me and showcase my work. 
            I made it from scratch using React and the source code is available <a href="https://github.com/willconry/conry.ca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Here</a>.
            It is still a work in progress.
